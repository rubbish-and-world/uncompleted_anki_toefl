### Resource:

* a word list(.txt file)
* a dictionary with pronunciation(.mdx file)

### Product:

* an anki deck or something like that

-------

1. - [x] Extract text and audio from .mdx(Thanks for xwang's script, it's quite useful.)
2. - [ ] Find each word in dictionary.txt
3. - [ ] write the content to a .csv file and move the audio file to `collection.media` directory
     * let html find the audio file
     * use anki
4. - [ ] write a beautiful and simple template that fit the dictionary layout well
5. - [ ] mannually import .csv into anki template
6. - [ ] export it as anki package (.akpg)



---------

### Finally I use an Anki plugin called `FastWordQuery`to meet this request
